## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an animator, I want to provide a 2D animation clip to the system, so that it automatically analyzes the motion and applies appropriate frame timing (2-frame exposure, 3-frame exposure, or holds). This will properly render the "tame" (anticipation/holds) and "tsume" (impact/acceleration), and output a new video file with the professionally timed animation, saving me manual effort.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an animation clip with intense, fast action, **When** the system processes the clip, **Then** the output video MUST use 2-frame exposure for the high-action parts.
2. **Given** an animation clip with slow, deliberate movement, **When** the system processes the clip, **Then** the output video MUST use 3-frame exposure for these sections.
3. **Given** an animation clip where a character holds a pose before a fast action ("tame"), **When** the system processes the clip, **Then** the system MUST NOT drop frames during the hold, preserving the dramatic pause.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when processing a clip with no detectable characters or motion?
- How does the system handle an input video with a variable frame rate?
- What is the expected behavior for extremely short clips (e.g., under 0.5 seconds)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a 2D animation video file (e.g., mp4, avi) and its frame rate as input.
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze character motion by detecting keypoints on a frame-by-frame basis.
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate a `MotionIntensity` score for each frame based on a weighted formula of normalized displacement, velocity, acceleration, direction change, and pose change.
- **FR-004**: System MUST classify each frame's motion level into one of three states (e.g., HIGH, MID, LOW) based on the `MotionIntensity` score and configurable thresholds.
- **FR-005**: System MUST use a hysteresis mechanism with configurable upper and lower bounds to ensure stable classification and prevent rapid, flickering changes between motion states.
- **FR-006**: System MUST apply 2-frame exposure ("2-koma uchi") to sections classified as HIGH motion.
- **FR-007**: System MUST apply 3-frame exposure ("3-koma uchi") to sections classified as MID motion.
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve original frames (no frame dropping) for sections classified as LOW motion to create a "tame" (hold or anticipation).
- **FR-009**: System MUST identify "tsume" (the start of an acceleration) and ensure frames immediately preceding it are preserved to emphasize the "tame".
- **FR-010**: System MUST output a new video file with the adjusted frame timing applied.
- **FR-011**: System MUST output the time-series data of the calculated `MotionIntensity` score and the final frame classification (HIGH/MID/LOW) for analysis.
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure that any continuous motion state (e.g., HIGH, MID, LOW) persists for a minimum duration to prevent jarring, single-frame timing changes. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the default minimum duration? The presentation mentions 0.08s and 0.1s.]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AnimationClip**: Represents the input video, characterized by its content, frame rate, and resolution.
- **Frame**: A single image within the AnimationClip at a specific timestamp.
- **Keypoints**: A set of 2D coordinates (`x`, `y`) on a Frame, representing a character's pose.
- **MotionIntensityScore**: A calculated numerical value (0-1) assigned to a Frame, quantifying the intensity of motion.
- **MotionState**: A classification label (HIGH, MID, LOW) assigned to a Frame or a sequence of Frames, determined by the MotionIntensityScore.
